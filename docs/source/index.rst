gdeploy user guide
==================
gdeploy is an `Ansible <https://www.ansible.com>`_ based deployment tool.
Initially gdeploy was written to install GlusterFS clusters, eventually it grew
out to do lot of other things. On a given set of hosts, gdeploy can create
physical volumes, volume groups, and logical volumes, install packages,
subscribe to RHN channels, run shell commands, create GlusterFS volumes and
lot more.
