This is an effort to automate the entire process, the script replace_node.sh is
a wrapper script around gdeploy configuration file. It takes three parameters:
`Existing node name', `new node name', and `volume name'. The script generates
a configuration file, and calls gdeploy with the configuration file as an
argument. This handles clusters with multiple hosts and just two hosts.

USAGE:

$ gluster-replace-node NODE-1 NODE-2 VOLUMENAME

*******************************************************************************
Node NODE-2 will be replaced with configuration from NODE-1
It is very important to give the node names right. Review before continuing.

ENSURE TO EDIT THE FILE:
/usr/share/gdeploy/usecases/replace-node/replace_node.conf.template
And change the devices variable to point the right device.
*******************************************************************************

Continue(y/N):


-------------------------

When continued NODE-2 will be added into the cluster and self-heal is triggered.

Prerequisites:
===========
1. Password less ssh from node-1 to node-2
2. Passwordless ssh from the laptop to node-1, node-2
3. Edit the file:
   /usr/share/gdeploy/usecases/replace-node/replace_node.conf.template
   And replace the devices varible with the device on the node.

Configuration generation and additional script generation and invocation is
managed by gdeploy.
