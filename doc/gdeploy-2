gdeploy Architecture for release 2


Summary:

In this architecture we are focusing on making gdeploy binary a tool
that can be used to parse a configuration and do a specific set of
actions on N number of host machines using ansible. These specific set
of actions can be either core gdeploy actions(peer probe, volume
management, client management, etc.) or extra features like snapshot,
geo-replication etc. The extra features will be pluggable modules and
should go into the `features/' directory, making gdeploy core scripts
separate and independent of everything else. This will make the
developer's life much easier if she wishes to automate a new GlusterFS
feature using gdeploy. And avoids regressions in core features and
maintainability a lot easier.

gdeploy-2 will let users to run custom scripts on N number of host
machines. The custom scripts have to be placed in `extras/' directory.
The arguments to be passed and such behavioral features will be
specific to that of the custom script. This will add an extra level of
abstraction to gdeploy, will keep additional features separate allowing
gdeploy binary to be lean. This makes gdeploy flexible allowing users
to add new and fancier features without touching the core modules.

Changing to the above mentioned architecture will change the entire
directory structure of gdeploy and most of the code that is currently
working. Despite the changes, gdeploy interface to end users remains
unchanged, and the above changes transparent.

Developing features for gdeploy
-------------------------------

    In the above mentioned architecture, if one wants to add a new
feature to gdeploy, she has to add two files to a directory inside the
features directory.

When gdeploy binary is run with configuration file as an argument, it
will first look for all the core sections like backend-setup, peer,
volume, clients, and backend-reset. After this, gdeploy will parse the
rest of the configuration file and reads in the provided section names.
Then it will look for directory with this section name inside the
features directory. So it is important for the developer to document
the section name(which is same as the directory name) properly so that
the user won't be confused.

Once the appropriate directory is found for the section, gdeploy goes
ahead with the validation of user provided data by looking into what's
given inside the <feature-name>-feature.in file. For example, the file
looks like:

Section: <feature name>

Options:

Name: Option1
Description: Example option
Required: True
format: .*option-.*

Name: Option2
Description: Example option 2
Required: False
Default: Bilbo

The user's configuration file will be parsed looking for each of the
mentioned options in the .in file, validating it based on the required
and format fields, setting default value, etc. At the end of this step,
gdeploy will have a global python dictionary named section_dict which
will contain key value pairs corresponding to each of the option name
and it's value(s). If anymore feature specific changes are to be made in
this key value pair, that can be done using the python script specified
inside the directory. An example for such a change would be splitting up
of a particular value into N values, etc. Along with this, the developer
can ask gdeploy to write specific values to hostvars instead of
groupvars. API functions for this will be documented properly in gdeploy
man pages.

We expect developer to be acquainted with Ansible module creation and
development workflow as we want her to add a YAML file(ansible playbook)
in the same directory which is to be run making use of an Ansible
modules on the remote machines. While the first part just involved
parsing the configuration file, this involves the real operation to be
done on the remote machine. If the developer wishes to write her own
Ansible module, she has to add the code inside the ansible_modules
directory in the code base.

There will be tests written to check if the feature addition is proper
and obeys all the ansible requirements which can be run after doing a
feature addition.

Addition of the extras directory:

This is a very simple addition to gdeploy, with which one can run an
external python code using gdeploy library on remote machines without
worrying about writing ansible modules and playbooks.
