                            ##-- Back-end setup --##

# Gluster specific backend-setup [We follow some recommended performance
# efficient calculations here]
#
# Back-end setup in one or more remote machines can be done using the
# section 'backend-setup'.
#
# Backend setup data can be given specific to each host or common to all
# of them.
#
# Host specific configuration:
#
# [backend-setup:10.70.46.13]
# devices=/dev/sdb,/dev/vdb,/dev/vda
# vgs=CUSTOM_vg{1..3}
# pools=CUSTOM_pool1,CUSTOM_pool2,CUSTOM_pool3
# lvs=CUSTOM_lv1,CUSTOM_lv2,CUSTOM_lv3
# mountpoints=/gluster/brick1,/gluster/brick2,/gluster/brick3
# brick_dirs=glusterbrick{1,2,3}
#
#
# Common configuration for all the hosts
#
# [backend-setup]
# devices=/dev/sdb
# vgs=CUSTOM_vg1
# pools=CUSTOM_pool1
# lvs=CUSTOM_lv1
# mountpoints=/gluster/brick1
# brick_dirs=glusterbrick1
#
# With the above configuration, the setup will be done on all the
# machines specified under the 'hosts' section with the above data.
#
# Both these can be mixed up and used.
# Example:
#
# [backend-setup:10.70.46.13]
# devices=/dev/sdb,/dev/vdb,/dev/vda
# vgs=CUSTOM_vg1,CUSTOM_vg2,CUSTOM_vg3
# pools=CUSTOM_pool1,CUSTOM_pool2,CUSTOM_pool3
# lvs=CUSTOM_lv1,CUSTOM_lv2,CUSTOM_lv3
# mountpoints=/gluster/brick1,/gluster/brick2,/gluster/brick3
# brick_dirs=glusterbrick{1,2,3}
#
# [backend-setup]
# devices=/dev/sdb
# vgs=CUSTOM_vg1
# pools=CUSTOM_pool1
# lvs=CUSTOM_lv1
# mountpoints=/gluster/brick1
# brick_dirs=glusterbrick1
#
# With this configuration, for the host 10.70.46.13, the first
# configuration will be used and for the rest of the machines specified
# under 'hosts' section the second configuration will be used.
#
#
#  Section 'default'
#
#
# If the user want to stop setup at a particular step, say, at VG
# creation, it can be done as follows:
#
# [default]
# no
#
# [backend-setup]
# devices=/dev/sdb
# vgs=CUSTOM_vg1
#
# Here, it will create the PVs and the VGs and exit. Setting 'default'
# section to no is important. It's default value is 'yes' and will take
# default values for lvs, pools, mountpoints, etc. and continue taking
# defaults value for all these.
#
#
#
# Non-GlusteFS back-end setup
#
# For this, to avoid the automatic computations being done an additional
# section 'gluster' set to no must be added
#
# [gluster]
# no
#
#
# To setup back-end, Configuration similar to following example can be
# followed:
#
# To setup back-end for hyperconvergence:
#
# [backend-setup]
# devices=sdb
# vgs=RHS_vg1
# lvs=lv_ctdb:1G,lv_engine:50G,lv_data:100%FREE
# mountpoints=/rhgs/ctdb,/rhgs/engine,/rhgs/data
#
# To add SSD for caching:
#
# [backend-setup]
# ssd=sdc
# vgs=RHS_vg1
# datalv=lv_data
# chachedatalv=lv_cachedata:1G
# chachemetalv=lv_cachemeta:230G
#
# NOTE: Specifying the name of the data LV is necessary while adding
# SSD. Make sure the datalv is created already. Otherwise just give it
# in the lvs section as well.
#
#
#
#
#                 SeLinux section
#
# If selinux is enabled, provide the value 'yes' in this
# section, so gdeploy can set selinux labels for the
# brick directories. By default it is 'no'.

# This field can be left empty in which case a directory will be created
# inside the mountpoint with a default name. If backend setup is not being done
# this field will be ignored.

# IMP: If only gluster deployment is to be done and not back-end setup, just
# provide value for 'brick_dirs' option, skipping all the above data other than
# 'hosts' and skip ahead to the 'volume' section

# [brick_dirs]

                            ##-- backend-reset --##


# This section allows backend reset in remote machines. Backend reset includes
# unmouting of LVs and deletion of LVs, VGs, and PVs.
#
# NOTE: Make sure you have your data backed up before using this
#
# To delete PV, VG, LV and to unmount it:
#
# [backend-reset]
# pvs=/dev/sdb,/dev/vdb
# unmount=yes
#
# This will automatically figure out the VGs and LVs associated and delete them
# in all the hosts specified under 'hosts' section.
# Giving the option unmount=yes is necessary. This is to make sure the user knows
# what she/he is up to. If not specified or given 'no', then gdeploy will try
# removing lv directly without unmounting and if mounted this will fail,
#
# To unmount bricks without going for other resets, one can use:
#
# [backend-reset]
# mountpoints=/dev/GLUSTER_vg1/GLUSTER_lv1,/dev/GLUSTER_vg2/GLUSTER_lv2
# unmount=yes
#
# To remove LVs only:
#
# With unmount:
#
# [backend-reset]
# lvs=GLUSTER_lv{1,2}
# unmount=yes
#
#
# Without unmount:
#
# [backend-reset]
# lvs=GLUSTER_lv1,GLUSTER_lv2
#
#
# To remove VGs and associated LVs only:
#
# With unmount:
#
# [backend-reset]
# vgs=GLUSTER_vg1,GLUSTER_vg2
# unmount=yes
#
#
# Without unmount:
#
# [backend-reset]
# vgs=GLUSTER_vg{1,2}
#
#
# To remove backend in n different machines with different configurations:
#
# [backend-reset:10.70.46.15]
# pvs=/dev/sdb,/dev/vdb
# unmount=yes
#
#
# [backend-reset:10.70.46.13]
# pvs=/dev/sdb
# unmount=yes
#
# Here 'hosts' section in not necessary
#----------------------------------
                            ##-- peer --##


# The section peer specifies the configurations for the Trusted Storage
# Pool management(TSP)

# This section helps in making all the hosts specified in the section 'hosts'
# to either probe each other making the TSP or detach all of them from TSP

# The only option in this section is the option names 'manage' which can have
# it's values to be  [probe, detach, ignore]

# If provided 'ignore' it will skip the peer probing completely even for volume
# creation and add-brick for which usually they run by default

# To do a peer probe

[peer]
manage=probe

# To do a peer detach

# [peer]
# manage=detach

#-----------------------------------


                            ##-- Volume --##



# The section volume specifies the configuration options for the volume.

# 'action' option specifies what action id to be performed in the volume.
# The choices are: [create, delete, add-brick, remove-brick, rebalance,
# set].

# If delete is provided all the options other than 'volname' will be ignored.

# If 'add-brick' or 'remove-brick' is chosen, extra option 'bricks' with a
# comma separated list of brick names(in the format <hostname>:<brick path>)
# is be provided.

# In case of remove-brick and rebalance, 'state' option should also
# be provided. Choices for 'state' are:
# For remove-brick: [start, stop, commit, force]
# For rebalance: [start, stop, fix-layout]

# 'volname' option specifies the volume name. Default is glustervol
#  If the user wishes to do just a volume operation, she can omit the
#  'hosts' section if the volname is provided in the format
#  <hostname>:<volname>, where hostname is the hostname or IP of one of
#  the nodes in the cluster

#  IMP: Only single volume creation/deletion/configuration is supported
#  as of now.

# 'transport' option specifies the transport type. Default is tcp. Options are
# tcp or rdma or tcp,rdma

# 'replica' option will specify if the volume should be of type replica or not.
# options are yes and no. Default is no.
# If 'replica' is given as yes, 'replica_count' should be given.
# Option 'arbiter_count' is optional.

# 'disperse' option will specify if the volume should be of type disperse.
# options are yes and no. Default is no.
# 'disperse_count' is optional even if the 'disperse' is yes. if not specified,
# the number of bricks specified in the command line is taken as the
# disperse_count value.
# If 'redundancy_count' is not specified, and if 'disperse' is yes,  it's
# default value is computed so that it generates an optimal configuration.
# An option 'force' can be used, in case the brick_dirs specified are
# some mountpoints and must be used anyway.


# For creating a volume of type disperse:

[volume]
action=create
volname=glustervol
transport=tcp,rdma
disperse=yes
disperse_count=0
redundancy_count=2
force=yes



# For creating a volume of type replicate:

# [volume]
# action=create
# volname=glustervol
# transport=tcp,rdma
# replica=yes
# replica_count=2
# arbiter_count=1
# force=yes


# To start a volume

# [volume]
# action=start
# volname=10.70.46.13:glustervol



# To stop a volume

# [volume]
# action=stop
# volname=10.70.46.13:glustervol



# To delete a volume

# [volume]
# action=delete
# volname=10.70.46.13:glustervol



# Add brick operation can be done by using:

# [volume]
# action=add-brick
# volname=glustervol
# bricks=10.70.46.13:/mnt/new_brick{1,8}

# Remove brick operation can be done by using:

# [volume]
# action=remove-brick
# volname=10.70.46.13:glustervol
# bricks=10.70.46.17:/mnt/brick{1,8}
# state=commit

# Rebalance operation can be done by using:

# [volume]
# action=rebalance
# volname=10.70.46.13:glustervol
# state=start

# Setting option to the volume can be done by using:

# [volume]
# action=set
# volname=10.70.46.13:glustervol
# key=cluster.nufa
# value=on

#
# NOTE: If multiple volumes are to be created, or multiple actions are
# to be done on volume using a single configuration file, suffix the
# section name with a number.
#
# For example:
#
# [volume-1]
# action=create
# volname=kyloren
# brick_dirs=/mnt/snook,/mnt/vader
#
# [volume-2]
# action=create
# volname=rey
# brick_dirs=/mnt/luke,/mnt/kenobi
#
# If there are multiple volumes to be created, provide brick_dirs under
# each section. Otherwise, it will error out.
#
#
#
#
#
#               ## SMB volume share

# To enable SMB volume share, along with volume creation or separately
# 'smb' option should be set to yes in 'volume' section.
# The other options necessary along with setting smb as yes are:
#
# smb_username: The Samba username. Default value is 'smbuser'
#
# smb_password: Password for the Samba user. Default value is 'password'
#
# smb_mountpoint: This mountpoint will be used to mount the to be shared
# volume on one of the Samba servers itself. For more info refer Samba
# documentation. Default value is /mnt/smbserver
#
# NOTE: Samba needs CTDB setup as well to work. Please refer the CTDB
# section below to setup this.
#
# Example:
# [volume]
# volname=smbvolume
# smb=yes
# smb_username=bilbo
# smb_password=shireeleventyone
# smb_mountpoint=/mnt/precious

# IMP: If only back-end setup is to be done but not GlusterFs
# deployment omit the following section

# Specifies the client hosts and client_mount_points to mount the gluster
# volume created.
# 'action' option is to be specified for the framework to understand
# what action is to be done.
# The choices are: ['mount', 'unmount']
# 'hosts' field is mandatory.
# The option 'fstype' specifies how gluster volume is to be mounted.
# Choices are: [glusterfs, nfs] (Default is glusterfs)

# If the fstype is given as nfs, the version by default will be taken as
# 3. This can be changed by providing the option 'nfs-version'.
# eg: nfs-version=4

# Each client can have different types of volume mount. Just specify it comma
# separated.

# Option 'client_mount_points' specifies where the clients are to be mounted
# in each host. Each host can have a separate mountpoint, in which case it will
# be given comma separated or else every mountpoint can have a mountpoint of the
# same name. If 'client_mount_points'
# are not specified, default will be taken as /mnt/gluster
# for all the hosts


# Mounting a volume using native fuse on 3 client hosts

#                           files that have not undergone edits. Value of
#                           this option can be [true, false]
# volume-id               - The option to delete the existing master UID for the
#                           intermediate/slave node. Value to this option should
#                           be a UID
# timeout                 - The timeout period in seconds.
# sync-jobs               - The number of simultaneous files/directories that
#                           can be synchronized.
# ignore-deletes          - If this option is set to 1, a file deleted on the
#                           master will
#                           not trigger a delete operation on the slave.
# checkpoint              - Sets a checkpoint with the given value. If the
#                           option is set as now, then the current time will
#                           be used as the label.
#
# Use only one configuration option at a time.
#
# If the value of any of the above option(other than volume-id) in set to
# 'reset', the setting of that config option will be deleted
#
#
# Examples:
#
#
# To reset log-level to the default value:
#
# [geo-replication]
# action=config
# mastervol=10.70.46.13:mastervolname
# slavevol=10.70.46.15:slavevolname
# log-level=reset
#
#
#
#
# To set checkpoint as the current time
#
# [geo-replication]
# action=config
# mastervol=10.70.46.13:mastervolname
# slavevol=10.70.46.15:slavevolname
# checkpoint=now
#
#
#
#
# Disaster Recovery
#
#
#  1. Failover
#  [geo-replication]
#  action=failover
#  mastervol=10.70.46.13:mastervolname
#  slavevol=10.70.46.15:slavevolname
#
#  Here mastervol and slavevol are the original master and slave volumes
#  respectively.
#
#  This configuration will first promote the slave to be the master and
#  then sets necessary configurations
#
#
#  2. Failback
#  [geo-replication]
#  action=failback
#  mastervol=10.70.46.13:mastervolname
#  slavevol=10.70.46.15:slavevolname
#
#  Here mastervol and slavevol are the original master and slave volumes
#  respectively.
#
#  This will make the original master be master again and demote the
#  original slave

                            ##-- CTDB --##
#
# This section allows setting up and starting of CTDB.
# Actions available are ['setup', 'start', 'stop', 'enable', 'disable']
#
#
#
# To setup ctdb:
#
# Make sure all the nodes in the cluster are specified in the hosts
# section. Gdeploy takes the CTDB nodes from that section.
# Set 'action' to be 'setup'
#
# Option 'physical_address': This option is only required if you plan
# to use IP takeover. Provide the virtual public IP address which will
# served by CTDB. The format of it's value should be like this:
# <Virtual IP>/<routing prefix> <node interfaces separated by semicolon>
#
# Make sure that the node interfaces are separated by semicolon and
# should follow routing prefix after a space. Interfaces are optional.
#
#
# If option 'physical_address' is specified, the CTDB_PUBLIC_ADDRESSES
# configuration option must be set to point to the file
# /etc/ctdb/public_addresses . This value is set by default:
#
# Other options with default value set are:
#
# CTDB_NODES=/etc/ctdb/nodes
# CTDB_MANAGES_SAMBA=no
# CTDB_RECOVERY_LOCK=/mnt/lock/reclock
#
# To override these default values, specify them as the values. If the
# option should not be set at all, leave the value empty or specify it
# as 'none'.
#
# Example:
#
# [ctdb]
# action=setup
# public_address=192.168.1.{1,4}/24 eth1;eth2,192.168.1.1/24 eth2
# CTDB_PUBLIC_ADDRESSES=/etc/ctdb/public_addresses
# CTDB_NODES=/etc/ctdb/nodes
# CTDB_MANAGES_SAMBA=no

# NOTE: Expect the user to specify nodes in the cluster under section
# 'hosts'
#
# To start CTDB
#
# [ctdb]
# action=start
#
# To enable CTDB on boot
#
# [ctdb]

                            ##-- Update remote files --##


#
#
# The section 'update-file' helps in updating the configuration file
# in the remote machine from the local machine.
#
# The configuration can be updated in 2 ways:
#
# 1. Either copy the config created in the local
# 2. Edit the configuration present in the remote
# 3. Add lines to the end of the file
#
# 1. Copy file from local to remote
#
# For this, use the 'copy' action in 'update-file'.
# 'src' should be the absolute path of the file in the local machine and
# 'dest' should the the absolute directory path where the file should be
# copied to in the remote machines
#
# [update-file]
# action=copy
# src=/home/bilbobaggins/hosts
# dest=/etc/
#
# You can send multiple files at a time. Provide them comma separated.
# 'dest' can be a single directory name or provide that too comma
# separated.
#
# 2. Edit configuration file in the remote
#
# for this, use the 'edit' action in 'update-file'.
#
# 'dest' specifies the file to be edited.
# 'replace' specifies the starting of the line to be edited. All the lines
# with the specified beginning will be replaced with what is provided in
# the 'line' option
# 'line' option specifies what the 'replace' is to be replaced with
#
# You cannot edit multiple files at a time. Although you can edit
# multiple lines at a time. Provide them comma separated.
#
# NOTE: Keep in mind that 'replace' specifies just the starting of the line
# you want to replace. Provide it carefully, otherwise one can end up
# screwing up the file.
#
# [update-file]
# action=edit
# dest=/etc/ganesha/ganesha-ha.conf
# replace=VIP
# line=VIP_10.70.46.15="192.168.13.14"
#
#
# 3. Add lines to the end of the file
#
# for this, use the 'add' action in 'update-file'.
#
# 'dest' specifies the file to be edited.
# 'line' specifies the new line to be added. This line will get appended
# to the end of the file. If multiple lines are to be added, give it
# comma separated.
#
#
# [update-file]
# action=add
# dest=/etc/ganesha/ganesha-ha.conf
# line=VIP_10.70.46.15="192.168.13.14",VIP_10.70.46.17="192.168.13.15"
